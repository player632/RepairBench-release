Ready-made light and dark styles for the [Domternal](https://domternal.dev) editor,
toolbar, bubble menu, floating menu, popovers, and every UI component. It is a
CSS-only package (no JavaScript), built from Sass and shipped as a single compiled stylesheet. Every
visual property is exposed as a CSS custom property, so you can rebrand colors,
fonts, spacing, and borders by overriding a variable instead of touching the source.
It also carries the paper layer: printing an editor produces the document rather than
the screen, with the toolbar, menus, popovers, and hover affordances hidden, and that
applies to the reader's own Ctrl/Cmd+P without any JavaScript. Colour is the one thing
printing takes back: the whole light palette is re-emitted on `.dm-editor` with
`!important`, so a dark document, and a custom palette with it, prints light. Hiding the host
application's own chrome around the editor is the one part that takes code: that layer is
gated behind the `dm-printing` class, which the `Print` extension in
[`@domternal/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@domternal/core) sets.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @domternal/theme
```

This package has no peer dependencies.

## Usage

Import the stylesheet once in your application entry point:

```ts
// JavaScript/TypeScript bundler (Vite, Webpack, esbuild)
import '@domternal/theme';
```

```scss
// Sass pipeline (imports the SCSS source)
@use '@domternal/theme/scss';
```

```html
<!-- Plain HTML link tag -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@domternal/theme/dist/domternal-theme.css" />
```

Light mode is the default. Toggle dark mode by adding a class to the editor or any
ancestor element:

```html
<!-- Always dark -->
<div class="dm-theme-dark">
  <div class="dm-toolbar">...</div>
  <div class="dm-editor">...</div>
</div>

<!-- Follow the system preference -->
<div class="dm-theme-auto">...</div>

<!-- Force light inside a dark context -->
<div class="dm-theme-light">...</div>
```

For a Notion-style look (borderless surface, centered narrow column), create the editor
with `preset: 'notion'`, which paints the `dm-notion-mode` class on the `.dm-editor` host
for you; adding the class by hand still works and is what the preset does. The reading
measure is `--dm-notion-column-width` (default `44rem`) and sits on the content column, so
the host itself stays full width. See the theming guide for details.

Override any CSS custom property to customize the look, on screen. Print normalises the
colour tokens (see the paper layer above); to keep a colour of your own on the page,
redeclare it `!important` in your own `@media print` block loaded after this package.
The defaults are declared on
`.dm-editor` and `.dm-toolbar` themselves, and a declaration on the element beats one
inherited from an ancestor, so target those elements rather than a wrapper alone:

```css
/* Tokens the toolbar reads too */
.my-app .dm-editor,
.my-app .dm-toolbar {
  --dm-accent: #e11d48;
  --dm-accent-hover: #be123c;
  --dm-accent-surface: rgba(225, 29, 72, 0.1);
}

/* Editor-only tokens */
.my-app .dm-editor {
  --dm-editor-bg: #fefce8;
}
```

## The hidden attribute

`hidden` works on every element this theme styles, and on anything inside one:

```js
toolbar.hidden = true;   // the toolbar is gone, not merely emptied
```

Worth stating because it is not free. `[hidden] { display: none }` comes from the user agent
stylesheet, and author styles beat the user agent stylesheet whatever their specificity, so any
component rule that sets `display` disables the attribute for that element. `.dm-toolbar` sets
`display: flex`, so a hidden toolbar used to leave an empty strip with the toolbar's background,
border and padding, and nothing in the console. One scoped rule restores it for the whole theme.

`hidden="until-found"` is deliberately left alone: it does not mean `display: none`, it means the
element stays findable and the browser reveals it when find-in-page lands inside.
