/**
 * Detection for the one dependency mistake that breaks ProseMirror silently:
 * two copies of the same module loaded into one page.
 *
 * ProseMirror compares by identity, not by shape. `Fragment.from` rejects a
 * fragment built by another copy, `PluginKey` lookups miss, and
 * `instanceof CellSelection` is false for a selection the table commands
 * themselves produced. None of that is a size problem, and none of it is
 * gradual: the very first document a duplicated `prosemirror-model` touches
 * throws `Can not convert <> to a Fragment`, with a stack that names neither
 * of the two packages that disagreed.
 *
 * The registry lives on `globalThis` under a `Symbol.for` key on purpose. The
 * whole point is to be reachable from a SECOND copy of this very module, and
 * a module-scoped variable would be duplicated along with everything else and
 * see nothing.
 *
 * ## The contract callers must keep
 *
 * `copy` identifies which physical copy of `module` the caller is using, so
 * every caller registering the same `module` string MUST pass the same export
 * of it. Passing `Fragment` from one call site and `Schema` from another would
 * report a conflict where there is none, so the choice is fixed per module and
 * FROZEN across `@domternal/core`, `@domternal-pro/core` and every package
 * that registers through either:
 *
 * | module                  | export                      |
 * | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
 * | `prosemirror-model`     | `Fragment`                  |
 * | `prosemirror-state`     | `Plugin`                    |
 * | `prosemirror-view`      | `EditorView`                |
 * | `prosemirror-transform` | `Transform`                 |
 * | `prosemirror-tables`    | `CellSelection`             |
 * | `yjs`                   | `Doc`                       |
 * | `y-prosemirror`         | `ySyncPluginKey`            |
 * | `@domternal/core`       | `ExtensionConfigurationError` |
 *
 * `@domternal/core` registers itself so that two copies of the editor core are
 * reported the same way as two copies of a ProseMirror module. The chosen
 * export is a leaf class that every package already imports and that has
 * existed for as long as the package has, so a mixed-version install still
 * compares the same thing on both sides.
