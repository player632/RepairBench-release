/**
 * The negative control for the whole single-copy feature.
 *
 * Every other test around this one simulates a duplicate by putting a stand-in
 * object into the registry. That proves the reporting path and nothing else: it
 * never shows that the thing being reported is real, that two copies of a
 * module actually define different classes, or that ProseMirror actually fails
 * when they meet. If the premise were wrong, or the frozen export chosen per
 * module were the wrong one to compare, those tests would all still pass.
 *
 * So this file makes REAL second copies, two different ways, because the two
 * halves of the problem live in different module systems:
 *
 * - a published dependency is loaded by Node, which keys its module registry by
 *   URL, so importing the same file with a query string evaluates it again;
 * - our own source is loaded by Vite, whose registry `vi.resetModules()` clears,
 *   so the next import re-evaluates it.
 *
 * Both produce exactly what a nested install produces at runtime: the same code
 * evaluated twice, defining two sets of classes that share a name and nothing
 * else.
