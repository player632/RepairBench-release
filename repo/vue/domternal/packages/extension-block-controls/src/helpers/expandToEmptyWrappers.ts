 * `deleteBlock`. Without it:
 *
 * - Move: dragging the only `<li>` out of a nested `<ul>` leaves PM fitting an
 *   empty `<li>` placeholder to satisfy `bulletList -> listItem+`.
 * - Delete: deleting the only listItem either leaves that placeholder or (worse,
 *   per fitter) unwraps and silently deletes the whole list.
 *
 * Two collapse cases:
 *
 * 1. Single-child wrapper (`block+`): parent holds only the source; walking up
 *    removes the empty wrapper outright.
 * 2. Single-meaningful-child wrapper (Notion-strict `paragraph block*` list
 *    items): parent holds the source plus an auto-injected empty filler
 *    paragraph (PM prepends one to keep the item schema-valid). Treating that
 *    filler as discardable keeps the chain collapsing as under `block+`.
