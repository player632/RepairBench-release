/**
 * Dumps the public export surface of every published entry point to a tracked
 * snapshot file, so that adding, renaming or removing an export lands as a
 * diff in the pull request that does it instead of in a consumer's build.
 *
 *   node dump.mjs           write snapshots
 *   node dump.mjs --check   diff against committed snapshots, exit 1 on drift
 *
 * ## The silent failure this ends
 *
 * The first version of this gate guessed at one path per package,
 * `packages/<name>/dist/index.d.ts`, and dropped any declaration file it could
 * not parse with a bare `continue`. Both halves were quiet. It printed "OK - 15
 * packages match committed snapshots" while only 14 snapshots existed on disk,
 * and it never named the four packages of eighteen it was not covering at all:
 *
 *   - `@domternal/pm`, whose entire surface is twelve subpaths and no `.`
 *     entry, so the path guess found nothing. This is the single-copy
 *     chokepoint of the repository: a subpath quietly repointed at another
 *     module is exactly the drift that ships two ProseMirror copies to
 *     everyone, and it was the least guarded thing here.
 *   - `@domternal/extension-block-menu`, whose declaration file is one
 *     `export * from` line that the name parser does not match, so it counted
 *     as a covered package while contributing nothing.
 *   - `@domternal/angular`, which ships ng-packagr output (`dist/types` plus
 *     `dist/fesm2022`) and never had a `dist/index.d.ts` to find.
 *   - `@domternal/theme`, whose declaration file sits at the package root.
 *
 * A gate that miscounts its own coverage is worse than no gate, because the
 * green line gets read as proof. So nothing is skipped quietly any more: an
 * entry point that cannot be snapshotted is a failure that names the package,
 * and the count printed on success is the number of entries actually compared.
 *
 * ## Entries come from the exports map, never from a path guess
 *
 * Every entry a consumer can import is discovered from the same exports map
 * that gets published, `publishConfig.exports` when one exists and `exports`
 * otherwise. Multi-entry packages are therefore covered by construction, and
 * each subpath gets its own snapshot named `<package>__<subpath>.txt` beside
 * the main `<package>.txt`.
 *
 * ## The source condition is never followed
 *
 * Free packages carry `"@domternal/source": "./src/index.ts"` directly in
 * `exports`, so the workspace can resolve TypeScript source while consumers
 * resolve `dist`. Snapshotting through that condition would record the surface
 * of source that nobody installs and would hide a broken build entirely, so
 * the condition is skipped by name in both collectors, and a types target that
 * is not a declaration file is a failure rather than something to parse. What
 * gets snapshotted is the `types` a consumer receives under `import` and
 * `require`, and when a package publishes both they must agree: ESM and CJS
 * declarations drifting apart is a real defect that only one of the two halves
 * of the ecosystem would ever notice.
 *
 * ## `@domternal/theme` is deliberately not snapshotted
 *
 * It publishes CSS and SCSS only. Its `index.d.ts` is `export {}` with a
 * comment, written so that a side-effect import type-checks, and there is no
 * value or type in it that a consumer can name. Snapshotting that would create
 * an empty file that can never drift, which reads like coverage while being
 * none. The surface that theme actually promises is its custom properties, and
 * `tests/css-vars` guards those. So entries that publish no JavaScript are
 * counted as asset-only and reported by name on success, rather than either
 * failing or vanishing.
 *
 * ## A star re-export is recorded as an edge, not resolved through
 *
 * Each `@domternal/pm` subpath is one line of `export * from 'prosemirror-*'`
 * (as was the removed extension-block-menu shim). Neither owns the names it
 * forwards. Resolving through would copy hundreds of third-party
 * symbols into our snapshots, and every upstream patch release would then show
 * up as drift in our public API, which is both untrue and the fastest way to
 * get a noisy gate switched off. So a star re-export is recorded as the edge
 * itself, `*(prosemirror-model)`, in the same spirit as the existing
 * `default(Source)` entry. That is what the package actually owns, and it is
 * the thing worth freezing: repointing `@domternal/pm/model` at another module,
 * or dropping the subpath, changes the snapshot immediately. Drift in the names
 * behind the edge is not lost either, because for a workspace target such as
 * `@domternal/extension-block-controls` the snapshot that does own those names
 * moves in the same diff.
 *
 * ## Stale snapshots
 *
 * A deleted package or a removed subpath used to leave its `.txt` file behind
 * forever with nothing noticing, so the directory slowly filled with surfaces
 * nothing published. Any snapshot with no matching entry point is now deleted
 * on write and is an error under --check.
