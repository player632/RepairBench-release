/**
 * Fails when a stylesheet in this repository could take the `hidden` attribute
 * away again.
 *
 * `[hidden] { display: none }` lives in the user agent stylesheet, and author
 * styles beat the user agent stylesheet whatever their specificity. So every
 * `display` declaration in this theme is a chance to disable the attribute for
 * that element, silently: `.dm-toolbar` set `display: flex`, and a consumer who
 * wrote `toolbar.hidden = true` got an empty strip, background, border and
 * padding intact, with nothing in the console to explain it.
 *
 * One scoped rule in `_hidden.scss` restores the attribute for everything this
 * theme styles. This gate holds two halves of that down:
 *
 * 1. the rule is still there, still `!important`, and still excludes
 *    `hidden="until-found"`, which does NOT mean `display: none`;
 * 2. every `display` the theme sets is inside the scope that rule covers, so a
 *    new component cannot reintroduce the defect by being written outside it.
 *
 * The compiled CSS is read rather than the SCSS sources, because nesting means
 * a source selector says nothing about the selector that ships. What matters is
 * what a browser is handed.
 *
 * ## The same file runs in both repositories
 *
 * In the free repo it checks the theme it owns. In the Pro repo it checks the
 * six stylesheets the Pro packages ship, against the theme they are installed
 * beside: the restoring rule lives in `@domternal/theme`, which no package
 * declares as a dependency, because the theme is a stylesheet a consumer
 * chooses to load rather than something the code imports. That makes the
 * coupling a convention, so a Pro surface is covered only while two things
 * hold, and both are checked here rather than assumed:
 *
 *   - the installed theme really does carry the rule, and
 *   - every Pro selector stays inside the scope that rule covers, which in
 *     practice means every Pro element keeps its `dm-` prefix.
 *
 * Today that is true of all of them. It is true by convention, and convention
 * is what this gate replaces.
