/**
 * Fails when `@domternal/pm` and a library that shares ProseMirror with it can
 * no longer agree on one copy.
 *
 * This is the root cause, checked at its source. `@domternal/pm` declares the
 * `prosemirror-*` packages as ordinary dependencies rather than peers, and
 * deliberately so: a consumer installs one package instead of twelve, and
 * neither version of Yarn installs peer dependencies automatically, so
 * declaring them as peers would turn a rare duplicate into a broken install
 * for every Yarn user. The guide records that decision in full.
 *
 * The price of that choice is this: the copy `@domternal/pm` brings and the
 * copy another library asks for are unified by the package manager only while
 * their ranges can be satisfied together. Today they can. A major bump on
 * either side would end that silently, and every consumer installing both would
 * get two copies with nothing to warn them at install time.
 *
 * The lockfile gate next door notices the consequence in the trees this
 * repository installs. This one notices the cause, in the declaration itself,
 * before it reaches anybody's lockfile.
 *
 * ## Why the sharers are discovered rather than listed
 *
 * A hardcoded list is a list somebody has to remember to extend, and the whole
 * failure mode here is that nobody notices. So every installed package is asked
 * whether it declares a `prosemirror-*` peer, and whatever answers is checked.
 * Today exactly one does; the day a second arrives it is covered without anyone
 * doing anything.
 *
 * Only caret ranges are understood, which is all either side has ever used.
 * Anything else fails rather than being waved through, because a range this
 * check cannot read is a range it cannot vouch for.
