/**
 * Fails when a shipped entry outgrows its gzipped budget, and when a shipped
 * entry has no budget at all.
 *
 * The first half catches accidental dependency bloat: a stray `lodash` import
 * doubling a bundle, a lazy payload that stopped being lazy. Budgets live in
 * budget.json, so raising one takes a deliberate edit and the diff records the
 * decision.
 *
 * ## Why the second half exists
 *
 * This gate used to iterate the budget file and look for
 * `packages/<name>/dist/index.js` under every key. That only ever checked what
 * somebody had remembered to write down, so a new package or a new subpath
 * shipped with no ceiling at all and nothing said so. Three packages were in
 * exactly that state: `@domternal/pm`, `@domternal/theme` and
 * `@domternal/angular` had no budget, which meant `dist/domternal-theme.css`,
 * the stylesheet every single consumer loads, could grow without limit and this
 * gate would still print OK.
 *
 * So the entries are discovered from disk, and the two lists are checked
 * against each other in both directions: an entry with no budget fails, and a
 * budget key matching no entry fails as well. A stale key is worth failing on
 * for the same reason as a missing one: it reads as coverage while guarding
 * nothing, and the next person to look at the file will believe it.
 *
 * ## Why entries come from the exports map
 *
 * The hardcoded `dist/index.js` was also wrong about what we ship.
 * `@domternal/angular` publishes `dist/fesm2022/domternal-angular.mjs`,
 * `@domternal/theme` publishes a stylesheet, and `@domternal/pm` publishes
 * twelve subpaths and no root entry at all. Reading each package's `exports`
 * map gives the file a consumer's bundler actually resolves, whatever the
 * layout, and gives every subpath its own key so none of them can hide inside
 * another's headroom.
 *
 * Conditions are followed `import` first and `default` second, never in
 * declaration order: our own `@domternal/source` condition sits first in
 * several maps and points at workspace TypeScript, which is what this repo
 * resolves and not what npm publishes.
 *
 * An entry those two conditions cannot resolve fails the gate. Skipping it was
 * the same hole one level down: an unresolvable entry appeared in none of the
 * lists below, so a package written with, say, only `require` and `browser`
 * conditions shipped with no ceiling while this gate printed its table and said
 * OK. A publishable package with no exports map at all fails for the same
 * reason. See `unresolvedEntry` for what the two shapes look like.
 *
 * ## What is measured, and what is not
 *
 * Runtime artifacts: `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` and `.css`, the bytes a browser or a
 * bundler loads as shipped. Source formats are skipped, because measuring one
 * would report a number nobody pays: `@domternal/theme` also exports `./scss`,
 * a barrel of `@use` lines whose real weight is the compiled stylesheet, and
 * that stylesheet is already budgeted under `theme`. Skipped entries are named
 * in the output, so they read as a decision rather than an oversight.
 *
 * Two export keys pointing at one file share one budget, held by the root entry
 * where there is one. `theme` and `theme/css` are the same stylesheet; two
 * ceilings on it could only ever disagree. Those aliases are printed too.
 *
 * ## Why every `@domternal/pm` subpath is budgeted separately
 *
 * The twelve are one-line re-exports of the upstream `prosemirror-*` packages,
 * around 60 bytes each gzipped, and a single key for their sum was tempting.
 * It would have defeated the half of this gate that is new: a sum needs its own
 * rule about which entries roll into it, and a thirteenth subpath would then
 * arrive under the twelve's combined headroom without anyone being told. A
 * ceiling per subpath needs no special case, and it says the one thing that
 * matters about these files, which is that each stays a re-export.
 *
 * ## The public marketing metric
 *
 * README size claims use one reproducible pipeline over the built core ESM
 * entry. "Own code" minifies that entry without bundling, so dependency imports
 * remain external. "Total" bundles the same entry and its runtime dependencies
 * for a browser. Both use the repository's pinned esbuild, target ES2022, drop
 * legal comments, and gzip at level 9 with a zero timestamp. Exact byte counts
 * are printed; README uses `~` and rounds each to the nearest whole KiB. The
 * gate checks those rounded claims instead of leaving a second
 * manually maintained size calculation to drift.
