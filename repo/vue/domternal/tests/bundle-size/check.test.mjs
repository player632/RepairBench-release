/**
 * Fixture tests for the bundle-size gate.
 *
 * The half of this gate that fails on a budget being exceeded announces itself
 * loudly the first time it is wrong. The half that fails on a MISSING budget
 * cannot: if the discovery is subtly wrong, an entry drops off the list and the
 * gate keeps printing OK, which is exactly the silent state it was written to
 * end. So the resolution rules are pinned here against fixtures, and the real
 * packages/ tree is checked for the entries that were unguarded before.
