/**
 * Fails when any identity-sensitive package is locked at more than one version.
 *
 * ProseMirror and Yjs compare by identity, not by shape. Two copies of
 * `prosemirror-model` make `Fragment.from` reject a fragment the editor itself
 * produced ("Can not convert <> to a Fragment"); two copies of
 * `prosemirror-state` break `PluginKey` lookups ("Adding different instances
 * of a keyed plugin"); two copies of `y-prosemirror` leave the caret unable to
 * find the binding collaboration installed. None of that is gradual, and
 * nothing warns at install time, so it is checked here instead.
 *
 * The lockfile is the source rather than `node_modules/.pnpm`, because the
 * store keeps orphaned directories after a dedupe until something prunes them
 * and the gate would keep failing on copies nothing resolves any more. The
 * lockfile is also what CI installs from, so it is the state that ships.
 *
 * Every lockfile PRESENT is checked, and on a development machine that is three.
 * The site deploys from its own, so a duplicate there would reach production
 * without the root ever noticing. In CI only the root exists, because the other
 * two are nested repositories this one excludes: the run there is real but
 * narrower, and the printed count says which it was.
