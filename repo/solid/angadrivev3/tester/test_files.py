"""File-related tests.

Covers the file websocket message types and both upload transports:
  * get_user_files
  * upload (primary: websocket transport over ``/ws/upload`` with 3
    connections per file; legacy HTTP endpoints are kept for the error-path
    tests)
  * delete_file
  * bulk_delete_files
  * convert_video (invalid-file error path)

Successful uploads go over the websocket upload transport. Several tests need
a second websocket connection to verify that a ``file_update`` pulse reaches a
connection other than the one that triggered the upload.
