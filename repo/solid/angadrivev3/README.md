## Tech Stack

| Technology | Description |
|---|---|
| ![Go](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=go) | Backend is written in go, it's a gonic-gin server is being used to serve up the compiled frontend files, and most updates on the frontend happen via a gorilla websocket connection |
| ![SolidJS](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=solidjs) | it uses SolidJS for the frontend (in the `web` directory) because i like how fast it feels |
| ![SQLite](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=sqlite) | Default database is SQLite because it's relatively portable compared to other relational databases like CockroachDB and MySQL, which makes development and deployment a lil bit easier, anyway the speed doesnt matter too much because we're caching the database in the backend, (but its still pretty fast!). |

## Self Hosting Guide

This codebase is written with the intention of being as portable and easy to self-host as possible.

### 1. First, clone this repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Anga205/AngaDriveV3.git --depth 1
```

### 2. Make sure all your dependencies are installed
<details>
<summary>
Bun.js
</summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>
FFmpeg
</summary>

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffpmeg
```

```bash
# For Arch/Manjaro
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

```bash
# For Fedora
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>
Golang
</summary>

You gotta have golang installed to run main.go, the script serves up the frontend too
</details>

### 3. Set Environment Variables
If you dont set them, they will default to localhost:8080
- `PORT`: optional env variable, set this to the port you want the backend to run on (default is 8080)
- `ASSETS_URL`: The url from which you plan on serving up the files (ideally you want this on a separate url from your main website to stop XSS attacks)
- `WEB_URL`: The url from which people will actually access the website
- `SAVE_DRIVE_RAM`: optional env variable, set this to true for *slightly* more efficient RAM usage (at the cost of slightly worsened performance)
- `GIN_MODE`: optional env variable, set this to "release" if you dont wanna get spammed by debug messages (also to make CORS policy more strict & safe)
- `VITE_API_URL`: the backend/API host the frontend talks to for internal requests (e.g. file uploads). In dev this is the backend server location; if empty it defaults to `localhost:8080`. In production the frontend is served by the Go backend, so internal API calls use relative routes and this variable is ignored.
- `VITE_ASSETS_URL`: the host serving file assets, previews, and downloads. Set automatically by the Go backend during the production build (derived from `ASSETS_URL`). If empty, it defaults to `localhost:8080`. You normally only need to set this manually when running the frontend dev server against a remote assets host.
- `MAX_RUNNER_COUNT`: optional env variable, the maximum number of compute-heavy background jobs (e.g. video conversions) that can run at the same time (default is 5).
- `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE`: optional env variable, the maximum number of compute-heavy background jobs that can wait in the queue before new requests are rejected (default is 100).

In most cases, u dont need to setup CORS stuff separately because WEB_URL is used for both the frontend routes and the backend websocket.
#### example setup:
```bash
export PORT=8080 # optional
export WEB_URL=drive.anga.codes
export ASSETS_URL=i.anga.codes
export GIN_MODE=release # optional
export VITE_DEV_API_URL="8080.angadbhalla.com" # optional
```

### 4. Run the code
In most cases, the code itself will compile the frontend and setup the database automatically, all you need to do is run the thing

```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```
