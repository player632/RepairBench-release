# Check and update process

## Check process

1. Verify that a container is suitable for checking (not a local image);
2. Pull image (if enabled in the settings, disabled by default), this may be handy if you are using a registry proxy;
3. Request current digest of an image from a registry;
4. Compare digests;
5. If different, the container is **marked as available**.

**Scheduled** process includes all enabled hosts and all containers **selected for auto-check**.

**Manual** process includes all containers despite the auto-check toggle, a single container, or a selected set of containers.

## Update process

- ### Dependency graph
  - Containers of a host are processed as a single set;
  - A dependency graph is built for that host from:
    - Compose dependencies (`com.docker.compose.depends_on` for containers with the same `com.docker.compose.project` and `com.docker.compose.project.config_files`)
    - Custom dependencies ([dev.quenary.tugtainer.depends_on](../README.md#custom-labels))
  - Dependencies are directional: if container A depends on B, B is started before A and stopped after A;
  - Containers without dependencies are treated as independent nodes

- ### Process
  1. The dependency graph is built:
     - [protected](../README.md#custom-labels) containers are skipped;
     - not `running` containers are skipped by default (can be changed in the settings);
  2. A set of **updatable** containers is calculated:
     - an updatable container has an **available** update and is either **selected for auto-update** or included by a **manual** run;
  3. A set of **affected** containers is calculated:
     - includes all containers that depend (directly or transitively) on any updatable container;
     - excludes the updatable containers themselves;
  4. A topological execution order is built from the dependency graph;
  5. Images are pulled for **updatable** containers;
  6. All involved containers (**updatable** and **affected**) that were running are stopped once, from most dependent to least dependent;
  7. Then, in reverse order (least dependent → most dependent):
     - **Updatable** containers are recreated and started;
     - **Affected** containers are started;
  8. After start, healthchecks are waited on; if an updatable container becomes unhealthy, it is rolled back to the previous image.

**Scheduled** process runs on all enabled hosts for containers **selected for auto-update**.

**Manual** process updates all containers with an available update despite the auto-update toggle (Check all / Update all on a host), a single container, or a selected set of containers. Dependents of those containers are still included in `affected` and are stopped/started with the plan. Select several rows in the containers table to check or update them together.

Check and update jobs on the **same host** run one after another (a check of A and B cannot overlap an update of C and D). Jobs on different hosts can run at the same time.

Per-host `HostState` is the source of truth: `current` job, `queued` jobs, and `completed` jobs. Each `Job` carries its own `containers` (status + result). Finished jobs stay in `completed` until the cache expires.

Optional [hooks](../README.md#hooks) can run around stop, update, and rollback when enabled.

## Update delay

Optional delay between detecting a new image and applying a **scheduled** update (security buffer while a bad release can be yanked or fixed).

- Global setting `DELAY_UPDATE_FOR` (seconds, default `0` = no delay);
- Per-container `delay_update_for` overrides the global value when set; otherwise the global setting is used;
- When remote digests change, `remote_digests_changed_at` is updated and kept as the last change time;
- Scheduled update runs only if `now - remote_digests_changed_at >=` effective delay (or delay is `0` / timestamp is missing);
- **Manual** updates ignore the delay;
- Notifications on check are **not** delayed.

## Previous image

After a container is successfully updated, the identity of the image it was
running before is recorded, so the previous version can be pinned again if the
new one turns out to be broken.

Everything is read from the image inspect that the update already performs
before pulling, so no extra registry requests are made.

- `previous_image_digests` — repo digests of the previous image, e.g.
  `nginx@sha256:...`. This is the only value that pins the exact image again;
  put it in the `image:` of your compose file to go back to it;
- `previous_image_tags` — repo tags the previous image had locally. Useful when
  the container tracks a pinned tag, less so when it tracks a floating one such
  as `latest`;
- `previous_image_version` — version taken from the previous image labels
  (`org.opencontainers.image.version`, falling back to
  `org.label-schema.version`). It is a hint from the image publisher: it may be
  inherited from a base image, be a branch name, or not be published as a tag in
  that exact form. Pin the digest, not this value.

Recorded only when the update **succeeded**. After a rollback or a failure the
container is running that same image again, so it is the current one and is not
recorded as previous. An update that could not collect any of the three values
leaves the previously recorded ones untouched.

There is no reverse lookup from a digest to a tag in the registry API, and
enumerating every tag of a repository to find one would cost a request per tag,
so it is deliberately not attempted.

The values are shown on the container card and are available in the
[notification templates](./NOTIFICATIONS.md).
