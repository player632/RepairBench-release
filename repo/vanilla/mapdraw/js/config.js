/**
 * LAYER DATA MODEL
 *
 * Every item on the map splits its data across two places:
 *
 * layer.feature.properties - portable GeoJSON content only:
 *   - the source's own content (description, stravaId, ...), carried through untouched
 *   - a `name`, guaranteed non-empty at creation time by every site that makes a layer
 *   - the item's color, under its simplestyle-spec key: "stroke" for paths and areas,
 *     "marker-color" for markers. Always read/written via getLayerColor()/setLayerColor(),
 *     which keeps exactly one of the two keys so a re-import can't pick up the wrong one.
 *   The app owns presentation, so an imported file's own style keys are dropped on import
 *   rather than kept as styling that was never applied (see DISCARDED_STYLE_PROPERTIES).
 *   layerToPortableFeature() turns this into the feature the GeoJSON Editor tab shows, a
 *   GeoJSON export writes, and autosave stores - identical per feature and unfiltered
 *   (each consumer covers its own set of layers), so anything put here ends up in the
 *   user's exported file.
 *
 * layer.internal - the app's own state, meaningless outside it:
 *   - pathType: origin/category ("drawn", "route", "strava", or the import's file type).
 *     getGroupTitle() maps it to the overview-list group, the layer group an item belongs to,
 *     and the KML export's folders; it also selects the info panel's item type and edit hint,
 *     the "original Strava GPX" download row, a selected path's z-index handling, and whether
 *     the elevation panel offers file elevation.
 *   - isManuallyHidden: per-item visibility override, flipped by toggleLayerVisibility()
 *   Never write these into feature.properties. Leaflet's toGeoJSON() reads only layer.feature,
 *   so this object stays out of the editor and every export by construction - no filtering
 *   needed anywhere. Autosave persists it in a sibling `internal` key, since that record is
 *   the app's own format rather than a GeoJSON document.
