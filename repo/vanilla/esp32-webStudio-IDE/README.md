# Update Notes – ESP32 Simulator

---

## What's New

### Board Selector
The board dropdown is now organized by chip family. Pick your architecture first, then your specific board variant.

- **ESP32 WROOM** – standard DevKit
- **ESP32-S3** – includes RGB LED and USB CDC support
- **ESP32-C3** – DevKit and Super Mini variants

Once you select a board, the **Project Template** dropdown updates automatically to show templates built for that board.

---

### Project Templates
Each board family now has its own set of ready-to-run `.ino` templates. Select one from the Template dropdown and it loads straight into the code editor.

| Board | Templates |
|---|---|
| WROOM | Blink, WiFi Scanner, Analog Read, PWM Fade |
| S3 | Blink, RGB NeoPixel (GPIO48), USB Serial Echo, PWM Fade |
| C3 / C3 Mini | Blink, Button Read, PWM Fade, TFT + Buttons (Mini only) |

---

### Flash & Serial Connection

**Flash / Connect** — opens a browser serial port dialog and connects to your ESP32. Once connected, the Terminal tab opens automatically and starts showing live serial output.

**▶ Continue Flash** — this button is disabled until you connect. After connecting, click it to send the code currently in the editor down the serial line to the device.

**Disconnect** — cleanly closes the serial connection from the Terminal tab.

> **Note:** Full firmware flashing requires Arduino IDE or `esptool.py`. The serial connection here is for monitoring and sending commands — Continue Flash sends your code as a serial payload, which works great for scripted or REPL-style workflows.

---

### Output / Terminal Toggle
The bottom panel now has two tabs.

- **Output** — validation results, status messages, and connection info
- **Terminal** — live two-way serial console. Type commands and press Enter to send. Incoming data from the ESP32 appears here in real time.

Terminal keyboard shortcuts:
| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `↓` | Browse command history |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear the terminal |
| `Ctrl+C` | Send interrupt signal (0x03) |

---

### Serial Shortcuts Button
Click **Serial Shortcuts** (or press the shortcuts in the table below) to open a quick-reference panel. You can click any ESP32 command in the panel to paste it directly into the terminal input.

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Connect / open serial port |
| `Ctrl+Shift+D` | Disconnect serial port |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Continue Flash (send code) |
| `Escape` | Close shortcuts panel |

---

### Improved Code Validator
The validator now checks against the specific board you have selected, not just generic Arduino rules.

- Flags `analogWrite()` usage — not available on any ESP32 (use `ledcWrite()`)
- Catches OUTPUT mode on input-only pins (e.g. GPIO34/35/36/39 on WROOM)
- Warns about USB pin conflicts on S3 and C3 boards
- Reminds you about RISC-V library compatibility on C3 boards
- Still checks structure, balanced braces, and `.ino` style requirements
### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flapjacode/esp32-simulator.git
cd esp32-simulator
```

2. Install dependencies (if using Node.js server):
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open in browser:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

## Usage

1. **Configure Pins**:
   - Click on any ESP32 pin to select it
   - Choose the appropriate mode from the dropdown
   - Assign a variable name and description

2. **Generate Code**:
   - Click "Generate Template" to create starter code
   - The editor will populate with properly configured pin setups

3. **Validate Code**:
   - Click "Validate Code" to check for common errors
   - The output panel will show validation results

4. **Export Code**:
   - Copy the generated code directly from the editor
   - Paste into your Arduino IDE or PlatformIO project
