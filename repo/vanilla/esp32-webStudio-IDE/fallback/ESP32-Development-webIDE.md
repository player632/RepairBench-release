### ESP32 Development Sim Tool
## Project Overview
This web application provides an interactive interface for configuring ESP32 microcontroller pins. The tool assists developers in properly setting up their ESP32 projects by generating boilerplate code based on their pin configuration selections.
A web-based ESP32 pin configuration tool that allows developers to:
Visually configure ESP32 pins with different modes (GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART)
Generate Arduino-compatible code templates
Validate code syntax before deployment
Test configurations without physical hardware
Support for multiple ESP32 board types
## Key Features
Visual Pin Selection Interface
Interactive representation of all ESP32 pins with clear labeling

## Pin Configuration System
# Select from multiple functions (GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, etc.)
Configure pin modes (digital input/output, analog, etc.)
Add custom names and descriptions for each pin
Code Generation

# Automatic generation of initialization code for individual pins
Complete setup function template for all configured pins
Board-specific code generation for ESP32 WROOM, S3, C3 variants

Start configuring your pins
# Development Setup
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Flapjacode/Esp32-Sim-Tool.git
cd Esp32-Sim-Tool
Install dependencies (if using Node.js server):
npm install
Start the development server:
npm start
Open in browser:
http://localhost:3000
Usage
1. Select Board Type
Choose your ESP32 board variant from the dropdown menu at the top of the interface
2. Configure Pins
Click on any ESP32 pin to select it
Choose the appropriate mode from the dropdown
Assign a variable name and description
3. Generate Code
Click "Generate Template" to create starter code
The editor will populate with properly configured pin setups
Code is board-specific and optimized for your selected board
