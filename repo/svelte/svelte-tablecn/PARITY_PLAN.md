# React Parity Plan

## Goal

Bring `svelte-tablecn` to feature parity with the original React `tablecn` in a staged, shippable order.

## Current Status

The local repo now covers the main editable `data-grid` and `data-table` surfaces:

- editable cells
- keyboard navigation
- cell selection
- copy, cut, paste
- search
- sort, filter, view, row-height menus
- column pinning, resizing, visibility
- virtualization
- context menu
- paste dialog
- data grid skeletons
- standalone data-grid select-column helpers
- README grid usage, paste flag, and undo/redo wiring examples are now checked against the shipped public API
- README data-table usage and option examples are now checked against the shipped public API
- `data-table`, pagination, toolbar, advanced toolbar, view options, skeletons, and filter/sort menus
- date, range, slider, faceted, and list-style data-table filters
- core UI primitive styling and slot markers for the shipped Svelte primitives
- `sortable` UI primitive is shipped, exported, registry-backed, and covered by source/browser tests
- `drawer` UI primitive is shipped, exported, registry-backed, and covered by source/browser tests using the existing Bits Dialog foundation
- `form` UI primitive is shipped, exported, registry-backed, and covered by source/browser tests using a Svelte-native error/context contract
- README now documents the shortcut dialog and standalone `drawer`, `form`, and `sortable` registry slices against the shipped public API
- The non-README docs now record the shipped shortcut dialog, standalone primitive registry slices, package-root/UI-barrel primitive helper/type exports, and select editor radius/offset parity fix
- The adapter decision for the current parity target is explicit: `drawer`, `form`, and `sortable` preserve the installable slots, styling, exported names, IDs, and ARIA contracts without pulling in React-only runtime dependencies
- Generated `static/r` registry artifacts are checked against `registry.json` so installable slices cannot silently miss or drift from their declared file targets
- The keyboard shortcuts dialog is source-checked against the original 50-row shortcut map, and browser coverage exercises gated row mutation shortcuts, optional shortcuts, filtering, and the upstream empty state
- README data-table component documentation is now checked against the package-root export surface, including `DataTableDateFilter` and `DataTableSliderFilter`
- README primitive export documentation is checked against the package-root export surface, including `DrawerPortal`, `DrawerOverlay`, `getFormFieldState`, and `getFormErrorMessage`
- README data-grid option documentation is checked against `UseDataGridOptions`, including sorting, filter, and row-selection change callbacks
- README data-table option documentation is checked against `UseDataTableOptions`, including required `data` and `columns` options
- Generated registry artifacts are checked against `registry.json` for item metadata and file `type`/`target` entries, not only artifact presence
- Date filter calendar popovers now use the Bits `initialFocus` prop where upstream calendars use `autoFocus`
- The data-grid single-select cell editor keeps the shared select content radius, original item radius, popper offset, and trigger width model while matching the active cell width
- Data-grid row-select cells render the original hitbox and read-only marker directly inside the row's standard cell padding wrapper
- Short text and URL editors cancel Escape edits back to the original cell value, matching the upstream contenteditable cell behavior
- Long text editors insert the first typed character through the textarea edit stack like upstream, preserving the native undo path for that opening character
- The file editor popover only contains Escape key propagation, matching the upstream file-cell popover escape handling while allowing ordinary keys to bubble normally
- The action bar exposes the upstream cancelable entry-focus event and item-select event ordering, with browser coverage for both paths
- Data-grid rows use the upstream custom-cell renderer switch based on function headers, with browser coverage for function-header and string-header cell renderers
- README registry documentation is checked against `registry.json` so every installable `/r/*.json` slice is listed
- Registry item names are checked against the original installable set, with `drawer`, `form`, and `sortable` recorded as intentional Svelte-only primitive additions
- Common registry items are checked to preserve upstream UI registry dependencies while allowing Svelte-specific additions
- The full `data-grid` registry bundle is checked for Svelte equivalents to the original core grid components, hook, helper, and type files
- The full `data-table` registry bundle is checked for Svelte equivalents to the original table components, hook, helper, parser, config, and type files
- Standalone data-table sort/filter menu registry slices are checked against the files their Svelte implementations actually import, avoiding unrelated advanced-toolbar/view-options/parser/config payload drift
- Standalone data-grid keyboard shortcuts registry coverage checks the slice stays scoped to the component instead of over-shipping data-grid types or table-core
- Standalone data-grid select-column registry coverage checks the slice stays scoped to row-selection rendering helpers instead of over-shipping the full table barrel
- The full data-grid registry bundle excludes the demo-only `use-window-size.svelte.ts` hook, matching the original installable registry scope
- Standalone row-height, view, and keyboard-shortcut registry slices declare only packages directly imported by those Svelte files; UI primitive packages stay behind `registryDependencies`
- The `data-grid.ts` module exports upstream cell-key and row-height helpers directly, even though their implementations live in Svelte type utilities
- Data-table date operators include upstream `isRelativeToToday`, and the in-memory filter reference maps/applies it using the same relative day/week/month windows as the original SQL filter helper
- `DataTableFilterMenu` forwards popover content classes and props to the command menu surface like the original table
- Data-table `isBetween` filters preserve partial range values like upstream, and the in-memory row filter reference mirrors upstream one-sided numeric range handling
- Data-grid single-select editors now preserve the shared select content radius and the upstream trigger width/offset geometry while keeping the original select item radius
- Registry audit coverage now directly fails on unresolved `registry.json` source paths before import/dependency checks inspect shipped files
- Data-grid search, row-height, view-menu, skeleton, context-menu, and column-header surfaces were rechecked against upstream; existing Svelte differences are adapter/reactivity differences, and the search structure now has explicit source assertions
- Data-grid paste dialog and cell-wrapper surfaces were rechecked against upstream; the dialog structure now has explicit source assertions for copy, radio options, callbacks, and popover containment
- Data-grid row-select hitboxes and read-only markers were rechecked against upstream; browser coverage now guards the standard cell padding wrapper and immediate select-all row state updates
- Data-table shell, pagination, toolbar, advanced-toolbar, view-options, filter-list, and skeleton surfaces were rechecked against upstream; the table shell and skeleton now have explicit source assertions for layout, pinning, empty state, pagination/action-bar placement, and loading placeholders
- Data-table filter-list select and multi-select value editors now use the shared faceted primitive like upstream, preserving the original badge-list trigger, option search, check item, count, and icon structure
- Data-table filter-menu chips use the original calendar popovers for date values and only handle row-removal shortcuts when child selectors are closed
- The package root and UI barrel now expose the faceted primitive value type, keeping the Svelte faceted contract available anywhere the exported primitive is consumed
- README UI primitive docs now distinguish package-root exports from standalone registry items and include the exported faceted primitive surface
- README UI primitive docs now list the full exported faceted primitive surface, matching the package root and UI barrel aliases
- Data-grid single-select editor popovers now use the shared select content radius while keeping the cell-width and offset alignment.
- Checkbox indeterminate indicators now preserve Bits' separate indeterminate behavior while matching the original check-icon visual and checked-only state styling.
- Dropdown checkbox indeterminate indicators now preserve Bits' separate indeterminate behavior while matching the original menu check-icon visual.
- Faceted item custom `onSelect` handlers now receive the selected item value like the original primitive, while default items still update the faceted value through context.
- Data-table range filters now preserve blank partial bounds in the visible inputs like the original two-input range filter while still committing completed bounds.
- Data-table sort-list direction options now read from shared `dataTableConfig.sortOrders` like upstream, and the standalone registry slice ships `config/data-table.ts`.
- Data-table filter-list join operator options now read from shared `dataTableConfig.joinOperators` like upstream.
- Data-table view options now read Svelte visibility state for reactivity while delegating the visible check to `column.getIsVisible()` like upstream.
- Data-table slider filter unit adornments now use the same absolute positioning classes as the original numeric filter inputs.
- Sheet portal and overlay slots now have public `SheetPortal` and `SheetOverlay` aliases in the sheet, UI, and package-root barrels.
- Data-table filter-list row reordering now uses the shared sortable primitive instead of bespoke drag-zone wiring.
- Data-table sort-list row reordering now uses the shared sortable primitive instead of bespoke drag-zone wiring.
- Data-grid sort-menu row reordering now uses the shared sortable primitive instead of bespoke drag-zone wiring.
- Data-grid filter-menu row reordering now uses the shared sortable primitive instead of bespoke drag-zone wiring.

## Audit Evidence

Latest upstream reference checked: `374e6aec098890a28a2cf36880be22c884b642dd`.

- Registry item names: local includes every upstream installable item; the only local-only registry items are the intentional Svelte primitive additions `drawer`, `form`, and `sortable`.
- Registry source paths: every `registry.json` file path resolves to an existing local source file.
- Package root exports: the root entrypoint exposes the shipped grid/table surfaces used by the README and upstream demos, including grid menus, skeletons, `getDataGridSelectColumn`, `useDataGrid`, `useDataGridUndoRedo`, table shell, table toolbars, table filters, table menus, pagination, and table skeletons.
- Runtime editor behavior: focused browser coverage now checks select editor geometry and shared select content radius, row-select hitbox placement, immediate select-all row state updates, Escape cancel for short text and URL cells, long-text first-character insertion through the textarea edit stack, Escape-only key containment in the file editor popover, paste dialog expansion/fit-existing flows, grid search open/reset/result behavior, calendar popover initial focus, faceted data-table filter-list option selection structure, faceted item custom `onSelect` value forwarding, data-table sort-list shared sort-order config usage, data-table filter-list shared join-operator config usage, and data-table partial range input display.

The biggest remaining gaps versus upstream React `tablecn` are:

1. a completion audit across exports, registry items, docs, and runtime behavior
2. optional follow-up issues for deeper `drawer` drag/snap behavior, richer `form` controller integration, and sortable keyboard/announcement parity if the project decides to go beyond the current installable primitive contract

## Recommended Starting Point

Start with the remaining shortcut and documentation audits, then evaluate the missing primitive ports one at a time.

Why this first:

- the undo/redo hook is shipped and the demo wiring tracks cells and rows, with focused edit, paste-batch, paste-expansion, selected-cell clear, document-level redo shortcut, global Escape selection-clear, and Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F filter/search shortcut conflict coverage now in place
- it improves the existing `data-grid` directly
- it is much smaller than the `data-table` surface
- it reduces the biggest credibility gap before expanding scope
- it does not require adding React-only dependencies like `react-hook-form`

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Finish Data Grid Parity

1. Verify keyboard shortcuts against the shipped hook behavior
2. Update keyboard shortcuts UI if behavior changes
3. Align docs with the actual shipped grid surface

### Phase 2: Validate and Tighten Grid API

1. Verify exported components match the upstream React package where practical
2. Remove or correct unsupported README claims
3. Add focused tests for:
   - selection plus edit history interactions
   - public select-column helper behavior
   - public package exports and registry entries (covered for data-grid)

### Phase 3: Close Missing UI Primitive Gaps

1. Keep `form` covered against the Svelte-native error/context contract while evaluating whether a richer form-state adapter is needed
2. Keep `drawer` covered against the existing Bits Dialog implementation while deciding whether Vaul-style drag/snap behavior needs a Svelte dependency
3. Keep `sortable` covered against the existing `svelte-dnd-action` implementation while closing the remaining primitive gaps
4. Add source and browser tests for any future primitive adapters' slot markers, classes, and core interaction behavior

### Phase 4: Final Data Table API Audit

1. Verify `DataTable` examples against upstream table flows
2. Recheck filter, sort, pagination, and toolbar public APIs
3. Align types, config, docs, and exports with upstream behavior where practical

## Acceptance Criteria

### Grid Parity

- undo and redo work for cell edits, paste operations, and selected-cell clears
- keyboard shortcuts match shipped behavior
- `data-grid-skeleton` is available and exported
- `data-grid-select-column` is reusable and documented

### Table Parity

- a consumer can build the same server-side `data-table` flows as the React package
- filtering, sorting, pagination, and toolbar flows are available through public exports
- documented examples compile against the public package entrypoint

### UI Primitive Parity

- shipped primitives expose the same `data-slot` contract as upstream where the Svelte implementation has an equivalent component
- `sortable` is ported with the existing Svelte drag dependency
- `drawer` is ported with the existing Bits Dialog dependency and upstream slot/direction styling contract
- `form` is ported with a Svelte-native error/context contract that preserves upstream IDs, slots, and ARIA wiring
- current primitive parity intentionally excludes React-only runtime integrations:
  - no Vaul drag/snap physics in `drawer`
  - no `react-hook-form` controller adapter in `form`
  - no dnd-kit keyboard sensor/announcement layer in `sortable`
    These require explicit dependency/product decisions before implementation.

## Risks

- `drawer` depends on Vaul in upstream React; the current Svelte port covers the modal drawer contract with Bits Dialog. Drag/snap physics should be a separate follow-up only if a Svelte drawer dependency is accepted.
- `form` depends on `react-hook-form` upstream; the current Svelte port covers the primitive contract. Controller-level integration should be a separate follow-up only after choosing a Svelte form-state adapter.
- `sortable` uses `svelte-dnd-action`, so dnd-kit-style keyboard sensors or screen-reader announcements should be a separate follow-up only if that accessibility scope is required for the Svelte dependency model.
- naming can still drift if exports and registry entries are not checked after each parity slice

## Next Milestone

Ship this small, clean milestone next:

1. complete a requirement-by-requirement parity audit across exports, registry items, docs, and runtime behavior
2. if the audit accepts the current installable primitive scope, track deeper adapter behavior separately instead of treating it as required for this parity PR

That gives the fastest path to a real parity improvement before opening richer adapter decisions for `drawer` drag/snap behavior or `form` controller-level integration.
