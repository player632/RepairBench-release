description: Add and manage the photos on the frame, from local uploads or a synced Immich album.
---

The **Images** page is where the frame's photos live. What it shows depends on the photo
library backend: local files you upload, or a synced [Immich](https://immich.app) album. You
pick the backend in **Settings → Photo library** (see [Configuration basics](/getting-started/configuration/)).

## Local photos

With the default **local files** backend, you upload and manage photos here directly.

### Uploading

Drag image files onto the upload area, or click it to pick them. Each one opens a quick cropper.

![The cropper: aspect-ratio choices, a framed photo, and the upload options below](../../../assets/screenshots/cropper.png)

Choose an aspect ratio for the screen (16:9 by default, or 9:16, 4:3, and 1:1), then drag and
zoom to frame the shot. The cropper remembers your last ratio. **Upload** stores the cropped
result, so large camera files shrink to what the screen shows.

To keep the whole photo, choose **Upload without cropping**: it saves the image uncropped,
scaled down to fit. Either way the frame stores a JPEG.

### Managing the grid

Uploaded photos appear in the grid below. The one currently on the frame is marked with an
**On screen** badge. Hover a photo for a delete button, or click it to open a larger preview.

To remove several at once, use **Select**, tick the photos you want gone, and **Delete** them
in one step. Both single and bulk deletes ask for confirmation first.

### Arranging the order

**Arrange** sets the order photos play in. Click it, then reorder the grid: drag a photo to a new
spot, or use the buttons on each one to move it up, down, to the start, or to the end. **Done**
saves the arrangement.

![Arrange mode: each photo carries move buttons, with Done in the corner](../../../assets/screenshots/photos-arrange.png)

The order you set is what plays when **Shuffle photos** is off (see
[Slideshow & display](/manual/slideshow-display/#the-photo-rotation)), and **Done** restarts the
frame on it right away. With shuffle on, a banner notes the order won't affect playback until you
turn shuffle off. New uploads join the end. Arranging is for local photos; an Immich album keeps
its own order.

To choose which two photos appear side by side under
[split-screen pairing](/manual/slideshow-display/#split-screen-pairing), put them next to each other.

## Using Immich instead

To pull photos from [Immich](https://immich.app) rather than uploading them, switch the backend
to **immich** in **Settings → Photo library** and give it a shared-album link:

1. In Immich, create a shared link for the album you want on the frame. A password is optional.
2. Paste the share URL (and password, if any) into the Photo library settings. Either link shape
   works: `https://your-server/share/<key>`, or `https://your-server/s/<slug>` if the link has a
   custom URL.
3. Set how often the frame reconciles with the album, then save and restart.

The frame then keeps a local copy of the album in sync, and the Images page becomes read-only:

![The Photos page with Immich: a status card above the synced album](../../../assets/screenshots/immich-photos.png)

The status card shows when the album last synced and how many photos it holds. **Sync now**
reconciles immediately instead of waiting for the next interval, **Open album** jumps to the
album in Immich, and a failed sync is flagged here with the reason.

:::note
On Immich 2.6.0 and newer, the frame exchanges the share password for a session token, so it
stays out of request URLs and server logs. Older servers fall back to sending it as a query
parameter on every request. Either way, keep your Immich server behind TLS and avoid reusing a
high-value password for the link.

## Where photos live

Local uploads and the synced Immich cache both sit under the images directory
(`slideshow.images_dir`, default `images`). The backend and Immich link are stored under
`[library]`. Every key is documented in the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/).
