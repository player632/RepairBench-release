# Changelog

All notable changes to SvelteForge Admin are documented here.

## v1.2.1 -- July 2026

Documentation and cross-promotion refresh.

- Replaced the Next.js "Apex" cross-sell with **Apex Dashboard -- Svelte Edition**, our flagship premium SvelteKit template (same Svelte 5 + Tailwind CSS v4 stack as this repo). All README and in-app docs promo links now point to the Svelte edition.
- Added a prominent Apex Svelte feature block to the README, plus a link to the [DashboardPack Svelte category](https://dashboardpack.com/templates/svelte/) so readers can find new Svelte templates as they ship.

---

## v1.2.0 -- June 2026

Dependency refresh plus mobile sidebar fixes. All packages updated to their latest versions; no public API changes -- existing code continues to work.

### Major version bumps

- **prettier-plugin-svelte 3.5 -> 4.1** -- new formatting tool major; the only output change was one component (`ui/textarea/textarea.svelte`) collapsing onto the new `{...restProps}` line style. Whole codebase re-run through Prettier.
- **svelte-meta-tags 4.7 -> 5.0** -- no markup changes required; the existing `MetaTags` usage in the root layout still type-checks.
- **@types/node 25 -> 26** -- matches the Node 26 runtime.

### Other notable updates

- SvelteKit 2.59 -> 2.68, Svelte 5.55 -> 5.56, svelte-check 4.4 -> 4.7
- Tailwind CSS 4.2 -> 4.3 (`tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/vite`), @tailwindcss/typography 0.5.19 -> 0.5.20
- better-sqlite3 12.9 -> 12.11 -- now declares Node 26 support in `engines` (no more install engine warning on Node 26)
- shadcn-svelte 1.2 -> 1.3, @lucide/svelte 1.14 -> 1.21, tailwind-merge 3.5 -> 3.6
- Vite 8.0 -> 8.1, Vitest 4.1.5 -> 4.1.9, @playwright/test 1.59 -> 1.61
- ESLint 10.3 -> 10.5, eslint-plugin-svelte 3.17 -> 3.19, typescript-eslint 8.59 -> 8.62, prettier 3.8.3 -> 3.8.4
- sharp 0.34 -> 0.35, tsx 4.21 -> 4.22, globals 17.6 -> 17.7, @internationalized/date 3.12.1 -> 3.12.2
- @sveltejs/adapter-node 5.5.4 -> 5.5.7, @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte 7.1.1 -> 7.1.2
- LayerChart held at 2.0.0-next.48 (pinned prerelease for Svelte 5 / shadcn-svelte compatibility)

### Fixes

- **Mobile sidebar stayed open after navigation** (issue #2) -- on mobile the sidebar is an overlay sheet, but nav links never closed it, leaving it on top of the page just opened. Brand link, all nav links, and the account-dropdown links now call `setOpenMobile(false)` on mobile (no-op on desktop).
- **`InvalidStateError: Transition was aborted because of invalid state`** (issue #2) -- a fresh navigation interrupting an in-flight View Transition rejected the `ViewTransition` promises, surfacing as an uncaught error. `onNavigate` now swallows the `ready`/`finished`/`updateCallbackDone` rejections; navigation still completes normally.
- **Stale unit test** in `users.test.ts` -- the "prevents deletion of last admin" case predated the admin-role gate on `/users` mutations and asserted `400`; with `requireAdmin` a non-admin is rejected with `403` first. Re-scoped to assert the admin gate (the last-admin delete path is now only reachable via self-deletion, already covered by the self-deletion test).

### Verified

- All 33 unit tests pass
- `pnpm check` -- 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `pnpm lint` -- clean
- `pnpm format:check` -- clean
- `pnpm build` -- production build succeeds (adapter-node)

---

## v1.1.0 -- May 2026

Dependency refresh. All packages updated to their latest versions, including major bumps for TypeScript, Vite, and the Svelte Vite plugin. No public API changes -- existing code continues to work.

### Major version bumps

- **TypeScript 5.9 -> 6.0** -- new compiler version, no codebase changes required
- **Vite 7.3 -> 8.0** -- newer build tooling
- **@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte 6.2 -> 7.1** -- compatible with Vite 8
- **@lucide/svelte 0.577 -> 1.14** -- icon library now stable at 1.x
- **prettier-plugin-tailwindcss 0.7 -> 0.8**

### Other notable updates

- SvelteKit 2.53 -> 2.59
- Svelte 5.53 -> 5.55
- Vitest 4.0 -> 4.1
- bits-ui 2.16 -> 2.18
- shadcn-svelte 1.1 -> 1.2 (chart component re-generated)
- LayerChart 2.0.0-next.43 -> 2.0.0-next.48 (pinned by shadcn-svelte 1.2)
- ESLint 10.0 -> 10.3, eslint-plugin-svelte 3.15 -> 3.17, typescript-eslint 8.56 -> 8.59
- better-sqlite3 12.6 -> 12.9, drizzle-orm 0.45.1 -> 0.45.2
- @playwright/test 1.58 -> 1.59
- Plus minor/patch bumps across all remaining dependencies

### Fixes

- **Logout button type error** in `app-sidebar.svelte` -- `requestSubmit` was called on `HTMLElement` (which doesn't have it). Now narrowed via `instanceof HTMLFormElement`.
- **Sidebar trigger ref binding** in `ui/sidebar/sidebar-trigger.svelte` -- `ref` was exposed as a bindable prop but never bound to the underlying element. Now binds via `bind:ref` on the Button, matching the convention used by the other sidebar primitives.
- **Stale state warnings** in `content/[id]/edit/+page.svelte` -- initial form values now captured via `untrack()` to silence Svelte 5's `state_referenced_locally` warning while preserving the original behavior.
- **Unused imports/variables** removed from `scripts/add-browser-frame.ts` and `routes/docs/+layout.svelte`.

### Build/tooling

- **`pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`** added to `package.json`. pnpm 10's modern approval mechanism for native modules (better-sqlite3, sharp, esbuild, @node-rs/argon2) -- replaces the legacy `.npmrc` `approve-builds=` flag, which pnpm 10 ignores. Without this, fresh installs leave better-sqlite3 unbuilt and tests fail.
- **`@types/node`** added as a devDependency. SvelteKit 2.59's generated `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` now references the `node` type definitions; without it, `pnpm check` warns.
- **shadcn-svelte chart component re-generated.** layerchart 2.0.0-next.48 ships with shadcn-svelte 1.2; the older local copy referenced `getTooltipContext`, which was reorganized in newer layerchart prereleases.

### Verified

- All 33 unit tests pass
- `pnpm check` -- 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `pnpm lint` -- clean
- `pnpm build` -- production build succeeds
