---

## Getting Started

### First Launch

When you first open Open DroneLog, you will see an empty dashboard with the import section expanded. The application automatically detects whether you have existing flights and adjusts the interface accordingly.

### Importing Your First Flight

1. Click **Browse Files** or drag-and-drop flight log files onto the import area
2. Select your DJI `.txt` files, Litchi `.csv` files, or Airdata `.csv` files
3. Wait for processing (the app will decrypt DJI logs, which requires internet on first import)
4. Your flights appear in the sidebar list

> [!NOTE]
> DJI V13+ flight logs require decryption keys from DJI's servers. You need to be online during the first import of each new log file. Once imported, the keys are cached locally for offline use.

---

## Interface Layout

The application is divided into three main areas:

### Left Sidebar

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **View Toggle** | Switch between "Flights" and "Overview" modes |
| **Import Section** | Drag-drop area and browse button (collapsible) |
| **Filters Section** | Date range, drone, battery, tags, and range filters (collapsible) |
| **Flight List** | All imported flights with selection, sorting, and search |

### Main Panel: Flights View

| Section | Content |

## Importing Flight Logs

### Supported Formats

| Format | File Extension | Source |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| DJI Flight Logs | `.txt` | Modern DJI format from DJI Fly app |
| Litchi CSV | `.csv` | Exported from Litchi app |
| Airdata CSV | `.csv` | Exported from airdata.com (all unit settings supported) |
| External Parser Plugins | Depends on plugin | User-defined parsers configured via `parsers.json` |

### Import Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Drag and Drop** | Drag files directly onto the import area |
| **Browse Button** | Click "Browse Files" to open a file picker |
| **Multiple Files** | Select multiple files at once for batch import |
| **Folder Sync** | Configure automatic import from a mounted folder |

### Sync Blacklist Behavior

When a file is deleted from a sync-imported workflow, its content hash is added to the sync blacklist so scheduled folder sync will skip that file in future runs.

You can manage these entries from **Settings → Manage blacklisted logs (count)**:

- View blacklisted entries with filename/presence status (when resolvable from the sync folder)
- Select one or more entries and clear only the selected items

You can also use manual import as an alternative blacklist removal for specific files:

- Import the file via **Browse Files** or **Drag and Drop**
- The app imports it and automatically removes that file hash from the sync blacklist in the same flow

This is useful when you want to re-allow and import a specific file immediately, without opening the blacklist manager.

### Duplicate Detection

The app automatically detects and prevents duplicate imports based on:

- Drone serial number
- Battery serial number
- Exact start time

> [!TIP]
> You can safely re-import files without creating duplicates. The app will skip any flights that already exist in your database.

### Customization Persistence

When you customize a flight (rename, add notes, change color, or add manual tags), those customizations are automatically saved in a persistent overlay keyed by the file's content hash. This means:

- If you delete a flight and re-import the same log file, your custom name, notes, color, and manual tags are automatically restored
- This works for both individual flight deletion and bulk "Clear Project Database" operations
- Manual-entry flights (which have no log file) are excluded from this feature
- Customizations are included in database backups and restored along with them

### Import Progress

During import, you will see:

- Current file being processed
- Progress counter (X of Y files)
- Any errors or warnings

---

## Manual Flight Entry

For flights where no log file is available (e.g., flights with other apps, flights before you started logging, or when logs were lost), you can manually create flight records.

### Accessing Manual Entry

Click the **Manual Entry** button in the Import section of the sidebar.

### Required Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Flight Title** | Optional custom display name (defaults to Aircraft Name if left blank) |
| **Aircraft Name** | Name or model of the drone used |
| **Drone Serial** | Serial number of the aircraft |
| **Battery Serial** | Serial number of the battery used |
| **Date** | Flight date (calendar picker) |
| **Time** | Takeoff time in 12-hour format (converted to UTC internally) |
| **Duration** | Flight duration in seconds |
| **Home Latitude** | Takeoff location latitude (-90 to 90) |
| **Home Longitude** | Takeoff location longitude (-180 to 180) |

### Optional Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Total Distance** | Distance traveled (in current units) |
| **Max Altitude** | Maximum altitude reached (in current units) |
| **Notes** | Additional notes about the flight |

### After Creating a Manual Entry

- The flight is automatically tagged with "Manual Entry"
- Smart location tags (city, country, continent) are generated from the coordinates
- The flight appears in your flight list and overview statistics
- Manual entries can be exported, but since they have no telemetry data:
  - **CSV** exports contain a single row with home coordinates and metadata
  - **GPX** exports contain a waypoint at the home location
  - **KML** exports contain a point placemark at the home location

> [!NOTE]
> Manual entries have no telemetry data, so the charts panel will be empty and the map will show only the home location marker.

> [!TIP]
> In the Date picker, you can also type a date directly in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and click **Go** for faster navigation.

---

## Profiles

Open DroneLog supports multiple named profiles. Each profile is a fully isolated environment with its own database, configuration, uploaded files, and sync folder. This is useful for separating data by pilot, drone fleet, client, or purpose.

### Creating a Profile

1. Click the **profile selector** dropdown in the header (next to the logo)
2. Click **New Profile**
3. Enter a profile name (letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores)
4. Optionally enter a **password** to protect the profile
5. If a master password is configured (Docker/web), you'll also need to enter it
6. Click **Create**

### Switching Profiles

- Click the profile selector and choose the desired profile
- If the profile is password-protected (shown with a lock icon), you'll be prompted to enter the password
- Each browser tab maintains its own active profile (via tab-scoped storage), so you can have multiple tabs open on different profiles
- Session tokens use a hybrid strategy: `sessionStorage` for per-tab isolation plus `localStorage` as a persistent fallback, so sessions survive browser restarts without conflicting across tabs

### Deleting a Profile

1. Click the **trash icon** next to the profile name in the dropdown
2. If the profile is password-protected, enter the profile password
3. If a master password is configured, enter it as well
4. Confirm deletion

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting a profile permanently removes its entire database, including all flights, telemetry, tags, and settings. This cannot be undone.

### Password Protection

Any profile (including the default profile) can be protected with a password:

- **Set a password**: Go to **Settings → Profile Password** and enter a new password
- **Change a password**: Enter the current password and the new password in the same section
- **Remove a password**: Enter the current password and click **Remove Password**

Password details:
- Passwords are hashed with **argon2id** (industry-standard)
- In web/Docker mode, a successful login issues a **session token** (valid for 24 hours by default, configurable via `SESSION_TTL_HOURS` env var)
- When a session expires or becomes invalid, the app automatically clears the token and shows the login overlay
- **Desktop auto-lock**: On the desktop app, profiles automatically lock when the app closes and prompt for re-authentication on the next launch
- **Lockout**: 5 consecutive failed password attempts lock the profile for 60 seconds
- Protected profiles show an amber **lock icon** in the profile selector dropdown

### Master Password (Web/Docker Only)

Administrators can set the `PROFILE_CREATION_PASS` environment variable to require a master password for creating or deleting profiles. This prevents unauthorized users from adding or removing profiles on shared instances.

```yaml
environment:
  - PROFILE_CREATION_PASS=your-secret-master-password
```

### Default Profile Password Bootstrap (Web/Docker Only)

Administrators can optionally set `DEFAULT_PROFILE_PASSWORD` to initialize a password for the `default` profile at startup.

```yaml
environment:
   - DEFAULT_PROFILE_PASSWORD=your-default-profile-password
```

Behavior details:
- Applied only when the `default` profile does **not** already have a password
- If a password is already set for `default`, startup **skips** initialization and logs that it was skipped
- If the env var is unset or set to an empty string (and no existing password is present), `default` remains unprotected

- Compatible with Google Earth and other mapping apps

#### Manual Entry Exports

Since manual entries have no telemetry data, exports are handled specially:

- **CSV**: Contains a single row with home coordinates and all available metadata
- **JSON**: Contains flight metadata (no telemetry arrays)
- **GPX**: Contains a waypoint at the takeoff location
- **KML**: Contains a point placemark at the takeoff location

- Protected profiles display a lock icon in the profile selector dropdown
- Passwords are hashed with argon2id and never stored in plaintext

### DJI API Key

Required for decrypting V13+ DJI flight logs.

- The app ships with a default key
- You can add your own personal key for better rate limits
- See the README for instructions on obtaining a key
- **Docker users**: Set the `DJI_API_KEY` environment variable instead of using the settings UI (e.g., `- DJI_API_KEY=your_key_here` in `docker-compose.yml`)

#### Status Indicators

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **None** | No valid key configured |
| **Default** | Using the bundled default key |
| **Personal** | Using your own API key |

### Data Management

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Backup Database** | Export entire database to a `.backup` file (includes all flights, telemetry, tags, customizations, and settings) |
| **Import Backup** | Restore from a previously exported backup file (replaces current database) |
| **Delete All Logs** | Remove all flight data (requires confirmation). Custom names, notes, colors, and manual tags are preserved for re-import. |
| **Remove Duplicate Flights** | Scan and remove any duplicate entries |
| **Manage blacklisted logs (count)** | Open the blacklist manager for sync-imported files, review entries, and clear selected items from the sync blacklist |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Backup files are portable and can be restored on any instance, whether desktop or Docker.

## Security Considerations (Web/Docker)

> [!WARNING]
> Open DroneLog does **not** include built-in TLS/HTTPS. If you expose your Docker instance to the internet, passwords and session tokens will be transmitted in **plaintext** over HTTP.

### Recommendations for internet-facing deployments

1. **Always use a reverse proxy** (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik) with TLS termination in front of the container
2. **Do not expose port 80** directly to the public internet
3. Set `PROFILE_CREATION_PASS` to prevent unauthorized profile creation/deletion
4. Optionally set `DEFAULT_PROFILE_PASSWORD` to avoid leaving the `default` profile unprotected on first startup

### Current security limitations

| Area | Limitation |
|------|------------|
| **Transport** | No built-in TLS — passwords and tokens sent in plaintext without a reverse proxy |
| **Sessions** | In-memory only; server restart invalidates all active sessions |
| **Rate limiting** | Per-profile lockout (5 attempts / 60s) but no global IP-based rate limiting |
| **CSRF** | No CSRF tokens; relies on same-origin policy and custom headers |
| **Multi-instance** | Session store is not shared across multiple backend instances |

## Tips and Tricks

### Performance with Large Datasets

- The app uses DuckDB for fast queries even with thousands of flights
- Telemetry data is automatically downsampled for smooth charting
- If charts feel slow, try zooming into a smaller time range

### Organizing Flights

- Rename flights with meaningful names for easy searching
- Use manual tags for custom categorization (e.g., "Client Work", "Practice", "Scenic")
- Filter by tags to quickly find related flights

### Understanding Telemetry

| Observation | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| **VPS differs from GPS altitude** | VPS uses visual sensors and measures height above ground |
| **RC signal drops** | Often indicate obstacles or range limits |
| **Faster voltage drop** | Battery voltage drops faster in cold weather |

### Map Tips

- Use satellite view for better spatial context
- 3D terrain helps visualize elevation changes
- Color-by-height reveals altitude patterns at a glance

### Backup Strategy

- Export backups regularly, especially before updates
- Store backups in a separate location
- Backup files are compressed and portable

### Docker Users

- Mount your log folder for automatic import
- Set the `SYNC_LOGS_PATH` environment variable to enable folder sync
- Set the `SYNC_INTERVAL` environment variable with a cron expression for scheduled automatic sync (e.g., `0 0 */8 * * *` for every 8 hours)
- Optionally set `DEFAULT_PROFILE_PASSWORD` to initialize a password for the `default` profile on first startup (never overwrites an existing one)
- Data persists in the Docker volume and survives container updates

### Privacy

- All data stays on your device
- Decryption keys are cached locally after first use
- No telemetry or tracking
- Use "Hide Serial Numbers" for screenshots

### Single Instance (Desktop)

- The desktop app ensures only one instance runs at a time
- Opening a second instance will focus the existing window instead of launching a new one
- This prevents database conflicts and accidental duplicate windows

## Troubleshooting

### Flight Will Not Import

| Check | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **File format** | Ensure the file is a valid DJI `.txt` or Litchi `.csv` |
| **Internet connection** | Required for DJI log decryption on first import |
| **Isolate the issue** | Try importing a single file |

### Map Not Loading

| Check | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Internet connection** | Map tiles load from online sources |
| **Toggle views** | Try switching between satellite and street view |
| **Restart** | Refresh the page or restart the app |

### Charts Look Empty

| Check | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Telemetry data** | Verify the flight has telemetry data |
| **Flight duration** | Very short flights may have limited data |
| **Zoom level** | Try resetting zoom level |

### macOS "Damaged File" Error

> [!WARNING]
> This is a Gatekeeper warning for unsigned apps, not an actual corrupted file.

Run this command in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Drone\ Logbook.app
```
