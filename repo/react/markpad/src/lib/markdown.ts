 * single hyphens. Unicode letters are kept (valid in HTML ids).
 *
 * Preview.tsx runs this SAME function over a clicked link's fragment, so a
 * hand-written anchor resolves to its heading regardless of punctuation or
 * smart-quote differences — `#q&a`, `#Q&A`, and a generated `#qa` all reach the
 * "Q&A" heading, and `#don't` reaches a "Don't" heading even though the
 * typographer curls the apostrophe in the rendered text. It stays encoding-free
 * (no `encodeURIComponent`) on purpose: markdown-it's link normalizer and the
 * browser percent-encode punctuation differently, so an encoded id and an
 * encoded href would not compare equal — normalizing both sides by stripping
 * punctuation instead makes them byte-identical.

/**
 * A fenced block in a diagram language becomes a placeholder that <Preview />
 * fills in asynchronously (see diagramMount.ts): drawing a diagram needs a real
 * DOM to measure text in, which this pure string pass does not have, and the
 * engines are megabytes that should not load until a document actually uses one.
 *
 * The source is emitted as the text of a `<pre>` inside the placeholder — not as
 * a data attribute — because DOMPurify strips any attribute whose value contains
 * `-->`, and that is the most common token in a mermaid diagram. Keeping it in
 * the DOM (rather than only in the markdown) is what lets the preview redraw a
 * diagram on a theme change without re-parsing the document.
 *
 * Anything that is not a diagram language falls through to markdown-it's own
 * fence rendering, so ordinary code blocks are untouched.
